Running \[i3-gaps, compton, polybar, i3-lock\] + various other repos to fix and get things to work on my laptop
    
TO DO:
Add screenshots (gifs too?) to show off the sweet setup

Here's an example of me working on a project, and yes, I work with gaps enabled :)

Did I tell you I can compile LaTeX documents in real time? Courtesy of Vim and Vim-live-latex-preview  

![](screens/lock.png)
Lock screen - works by screenshotting the current workspace, pixelating everything and overlaying the lock screen image on top

Transparency also works on i3! woooooo
